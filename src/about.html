              A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a
              book on theoretical cosmology by the physicist Stephen Hawking. It
              was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote the book for readers
              who had no prior knowledge of physics.
            </p>
            <p class="text-formating">
              In A Brief History of Time, Hawking writes in non-technical terms
              about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the
              Universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern
              physics. He talks about basic concepts like space and time, basic
              building blocks that make up the Universe (such as quarks) and the
              fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He writes
              about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes.
              He discusses two major theories, general relativity and quantum
              mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the Universe.
              Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that
              describes everything in the Universe in a coherent manner.
            </p>
            <p class="text-formating">
              The book became a bestseller and has sold more than 25 million
              copies.
